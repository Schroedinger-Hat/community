# Inactive contributors

_Contributors are continuously active in the community._

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time and they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

However, being a Contributor of Schrödinger Hat comes with an elevated set of permissions. These capabilities should not be used by those that are not familiar with the current state of the community.

Therefore Contributors with an extended period away from the community with no activity inside of it will be removed and will be required to go through the community membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state.
